We will use Python for all of the labs in this manual. We will take for granted that you have already installed Python on your computer, but if you have not, please follow the [instructions to install Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) on your operating system. We recommend using Anaconda3. If you already have Anaconda2 installed, fear not! You can still complete the exercises in this book, but you will have to create a new Python 3 environment. The instructions, below, will help you accomplish that. 

```{block, type="rmdtip"}
Do you need a refresher on Python? Karen (one of the authors of this book) provides an asynchronous workshop on basic and intermediate Python and you can take the workshop at your own pace. Find all of the workshop materials [here](https://kls2177.github.io/ctl-python-workshop/chapters/index.html).
```


Whether you are running Anaconda2 or Anaconda3, or one of the [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) variants, we recommend that you create a new Conda environment for this manual. You can accomplish this by writing the following commands from the base Conda environment (i.e from the Anaconda Prompt on Windows or after running `conda activate` from a terminal on MacOS or Linux). 

```{bash, eval=FALSE, deco=list(label="Shell", bc="#000000", tc="#ffffff", icon=list(style="fas", name="terminal"))}
conda config --prepend channels conda-forge
conda config --append channels claut
conda create -n "man_ccia" "python>=3.7.1" ec3 esgf-pyclient matplotlib netCDF4 pandas requests "seaborn>=0.9.0" xarray
```

This will create a new environment, named "man_ccia", which will contain all of the packages that you will need to complete the exercises contained in this manual, including Python 3.7.1 or higher.

```{block, type='rmdtip'}
If you plan to use Jupyter Lab (the successor to Jupyter Notebook), you can choose to either install Jupyter into your "man_ccia" environment, or use Jupyter from your base environment with an extra kernel for your "man_ccia" environment.

To install Jupyter Lab in the "man_ccia" environment, run the following commands:

<div class="decocode" style="background-color:#000000"><p><span class="decotitle" style="font-size:90%;color:#ffffff"><i class="fas fa-terminal"></i> <b>Shell</b></span></p>
    conda activate man_ccia
    conda install jupyterlab # only needed the first time
    jupyter lab 
</div>

If you prefer to have just one Jupyter installation that can access all of your environments, you can use Jupyter from your "base" environment and install a "kernel" for your "man_ccia" environment by issuing the following commands: 

<div class="decocode" style="background-color:#000000"><p><span class="decotitle" style="font-size:90%;color:#ffffff"><i class="fas fa-terminal"></i> <b>Shell</b></span></p>
    conda activate man_ccia
    conda install ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name="man_ccia" --display-name="man_ccia"
</div>

This command will create a simple JSON file that tells Jupyter where to look for the Python executable and the packages that are contained in your "man_ccia" environment. Once you have run those commands and re-launched Jupyter Lab from your "base" environment (or from Anaconda Navigator), your "man_ccia" kernel should be available under the "New" file creation menu and the "Kernel" options in any running notebook.
```

## Summary

By the end of this chapter, you should have Python 3 installed in a shiny new Conda environment that contains all of the packages and modules that you will need to complete the exercises in this manual.
