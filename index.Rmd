# About this book

This book is an open source document, hosted on [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) ([project page](https://gitlab.com/claut/man_ccia)), and [published](https://claut.gitlab.io/man_ccia/) using [GitLab Pages](https://pages.gitlab.io/), where you are probably reading it now. The book is automatically updated and republished every time changes are committed to the project, using the GitLab multi runner CI engine, and a [Docker image](https://gitlab.com/claut/man_ccia/blob/main/docker/Dockerfile) with a distribution of [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html), including Python 3 and R. The book is built using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in R, and pandoc. Most of the code is executed in Python from within R using the **reticulate** package [@R-reticulate]. The version of the book that you are reading, was built on `r format(Sys.Date(), "%B %d, %Y")`, from commit `r sha=Sys.getenv('CI_COMMIT_SHORT_SHA');sprintf("[%s](https://gitlab.com/claut/man_ccia/commit/%s)",sha,sha)`.
